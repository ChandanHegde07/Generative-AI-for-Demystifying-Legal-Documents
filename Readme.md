## Demo

### Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Upload Document** → Drag and drop PDFs such as **insurance policies, prescriptions, lab reports, or government scheme documents**.  
2. **AI Analysis** → The system detects the document type and extracts key data (e.g., policy details, medical parameters, claim eligibility).  
3. **Simplification & Summarization** → Converts complex medical or policy language into simple, everyday Indian English or regional language.  
4. **Interactive Q&A** → Users ask custom questions, like *“Does this policy cover hospitalization for cardiac surgery?”*  
5. **Risk & Compliance Alerts** → Highlights possible gaps, claim deadlines, or medical alerts.  
6. **Multilingual Translation** → Outputs available in **English, Hindi, or Kannada**.
